<h2 align='center'> Case Study 2 - Data Analysis and SQL</h2>

### Introduction 

There three (3) datasets to work with in this case study, broken down as follows:

- 1 and 2 - Transcoding Dataset
- 3 - SDSS
- 4 - SuperStore Database

Once again, the  dataset is a sizable dataset (roughly 8000 rows and 24 columns), so it is wise to consider your code in terms of complexity to ensure it doesn't take 30 minutes to run a single line.

Further reading on the datasets can be found in the following locations:
- [Transcoding Dataset.md](./data/cve/about.md)
- [Northwind Database.md](./data/bikestores/about.md)
- [SDSS Description](./data/SDSS_Description.txt)


In the second case study, you will know supervised learning, unsupervised learning and SQL.
